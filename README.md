Podcasts can be quite long, which makes it hard to quickly grasp the important takeaways.
Summarizing them helps you understand the key points without going through the entire episode.
It also makes it easier to decide whether the full episode is worth your time.

## üöÄ How to Use
Input: Provide the YouTube URL of the podcast episode you wish to summarize.

Summarize: The app fetches the transcript and processes it using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model.

Output: Receive a concise 10-point summary highlighting the episode's key takeaways.
